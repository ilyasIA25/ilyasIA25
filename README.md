## Project: VenturiX

This profile highlights a student project I contributed to at ECPM Strasbourg. This project, **VenturiX**, is a 2D fluid flow simulator built in Python.

### About This Project

The goal of this project was to make fluid mechanics visual and interactive. Our team created a tool based on the **Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM)** to simulate 2D fluid dynamics.

The live website (linked above) is a showcase featuring:

**Simulation Gallery**<br>
YouTube videos of different flow types, like laminar (Poiseuille) and turbulent flow, the Venturi effect, and flow around an obstacle (Kármán vortex street).

**Interactive Mockup**<br>
A simple panel that shows the controls of the real desktop app. It lets you adjust parameters (like viscosity and flow rate) and calculates the Reynolds number in real-time.

**Bilingual Support**<br>
The site is available in French and English.

### Core Technologies
**Simulation:** Python, using the **Taichi** library for GPU acceleration.<br>
**Website:** HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.<br>
**Hosting:** GitHub Pages.
