## Project: VenturiX

This profile features my student project, **VenturiX**: a 2D fluid flow simulator built in Python at ECPM Strasbourg.

### About This Project

The goal of this project was to make fluid mechanics visual and interactive. I created a tool based on the **Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM)** to simulate 2D fluid dynamics.

The live website (linked above) is a showcase featuring:

* **Simulation Gallery:** YouTube videos of different flow types, like laminar (Poiseuille) and turbulent flow, the Venturi effect, and flow around an obstacle (Kármán vortex street).
* **Interactive Mockup:** A simple panel that shows the controls of the real desktop app. It lets you adjust parameters (like viscosity and flow rate) and calculates the Reynolds number in real-time.
* **Bilingual Support:** The site is available in French and English.

### Core Technologies
- **Simulation:** Python, using the **Taichi** library for GPU acceleration.
- **Website:** HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- **Hosting:** GitHub Pages.
